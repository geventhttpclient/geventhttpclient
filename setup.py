A high performance, concurrent HTTP client library for python using gevent.

geventhttpclient uses a fast http parser, written in C, originating from
nginx, extracted and modified by Joyent.

geventhttpclient has been specifically designed for high concurrency,
streaming and support HTTP 1.1 persistent connections. More generally it is
designed for efficiently pulling from REST APIs and streaming APIs
like Twitter's.

Safe SSL support is provided by default. geventhttpclient depends on
the certifi CA Bundle. This is the same CA Bundle which ships with the
Requests codebase, and is derived from Mozilla Firefox's canonical set.
